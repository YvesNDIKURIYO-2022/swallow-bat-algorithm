Official implementation of **"A Bio-Inspired Swallow-Bat Algorithm for Threat-Avoidance Routing in the Container Truck Routing Problem"**.

The Swallow-Bat Algorithm (SBA) is a novel hybrid metaheuristic that generates cost-efficient and threat-resilient routes for logistics operations in high-risk environments. It uniquely combines swallow flocking for global exploration with bat echolocation for local exploitation, guided by a proactive threat-aware evasion operator.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YvesNDIKURIYO-2022/swallow-bat-algorithm.git
cd swallow-bat-algorithm
pip install -r requirements.txt
python experiments/run_single_instance.py
